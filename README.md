# Ads-Be-Gone

My first browser extension, and probably the most useful project of mine to date.

**[To installation guide](https://github.com/ZeroPointNothing/Ads-Be-Gone/wiki/Installation-and-Supported-Browsers)**

Tired of those pesky little ads that pop up EVERYWHERE?!?!?!
Now you can block it with this (open source, of course) ad-blocker created by yours truely!

Simply press the Block Ads? button on a page, and watch them get destroyed faster than I destroyed my sanity working with Javascript! (I'm kidding, this was fun to do XD)

## Disclaimer

Please note that this does not, and most likely never will block ads for sites like YouTube. That is an entirely different bag of things and I don't even know how they work yet. This Extension is *only* for webpage image/gif ads.
